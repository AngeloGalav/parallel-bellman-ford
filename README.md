# Implementation of the Bellman-Ford SSSP algorithm in CUDA and OpenMP

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm):

> The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
> It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.

## Results
The results of the experiment, as well as a thorough analysis of the implementation, can be found in the `project.pdf` file.

## Usage
### Usage on a Slurm cluster
Just run the `project.sbatch` file, which will compile and execute all models on all graphs:
```
sbatch project.sbatch
```

### Usage of single models
- OpenMP
```
./omp-bf [threads] [graph_file] [-b BIDIRECTIONAL] [-d DEBUG]
```
- CUDA
```
./cuda-bf [graph_file] [mode] [-b BIDIRECTIONAL] [-d DEBUG]
```
The parameter `mode` can be set to 0 to run the program on a single-thread, otherwise it is run in parallel.

## Compiling
On both Linux and Windows, you can use `./compile.sh` or the following commands to compile the project:
- OpeMP
```
gcc -o omp-bf openmp/omp_bellmanford.c -fopenmp -Wall
```
- CUDA
```
nvcc -o cuda-bf cuda/cuda_bellmanford.cu
```

## Tools
Graph Maker:
```
python tools/graph_maker.py [-h] [-v NODES] [-e EDGES] [-neg | --negative | --no-negative]
```

Plotter:
```
python tools/plotting/plotter.py
```
In order to function, the plotter needs the files `omp.csv` and `cuda.csv` (generated by the programs) to be put in a `results` in the root of the project.
