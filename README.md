# Parallel stuff

The objective is to implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm using both the OpenMP and CUDA parallel frameworks.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm):

> The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
> It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.
